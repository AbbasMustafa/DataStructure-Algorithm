task: 0
Wrost Case Complexity of Task 1 is O(1) becasue There are only two lines have to excute

task: 1
Wrost Case Complexity For this problem is O(n)
Becasue there are only one loop which is depend on Input Which is come from File

task: 2
Wrost Case Complexity For this problem is O(n + n) = O(2n)
So We Focus only on O(n)
Becasue there are only two loops one is for finding unique Value and 
second one is for finding maximum value in Dict

task 3
Wrost Case Complexity For this problem is O(n + n + n log n + n) = O(4n + log n)
So We Focus only on O(n)
Becaue there are lots of work which is done by step by step
1) Extracting areaCode
2) FindUniqeValue
3) unique Value Copy in Final List sorted
4) Calculate Percentage

task: 4
Wrost Case Complexity For this problem is O(n + n ) = O(2n)
So We Focus only on O(n)
Because there is only two loop two excute complete task
